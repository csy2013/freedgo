## What charts can be drawn

### UML

UML Unified Modeling Language (UML) is an open method for explaining, visualizing, constructing and writing an object-oriented and software-intensive product under development. UML shows a series of best engineering practices, which have been proved to be effective in modeling large-scale and complex systems, especially at the software architecture level.
There are three main models in UML system development:

-Function model: show the functions of the system from the user's point of view, including use case diagrams. 
-Object model: the concept of object, attribute, operation and association is used to show the structure and foundation of the system, including category diagram and object diagram. 
-Dynamic model: showing the internal behavior of the system. Include sequence diagram, activity diagram and state diagram.

You can draw various UML diagrams through Freedgo Desgin, including

-UML use case diagram 
-UML class diagram 
-UML timing diagram 
-UML activity diagram 
-UML swim lane diagram

Click `+more graphics ` at the bottom of the page and select ` business/(business modeling) ` -> `UML ` to design various UML diagrams, as shown in the following figure:

### 流程图

A flowchart is a graphic representation of information flow, viewpoint flow or component flow through a system. In an enterprise, a flow chart is mainly used to illustrate a certain process. This process can be either a technological process on the production line or a necessary management process to complete a task. Flow chart is an effective way to reveal and master the movement of closed system. As a diagnostic tool, it can assist decision-making, let managers know clearly where the problem may lie, and then determine the alternative action plan.  
Flowcharts are sometimes referred to as input-output diagrams. This figure intuitively describes the concrete steps of a working process. Flowcharts are very helpful to understand exactly how things are going and to decide how to improve the process. This method can be applied to the whole enterprise, so as to intuitively track and illustrate the operation mode of the enterprise.  The flow chart uses some standard symbols to represent certain types of actions, such as decision-making represented by diamond boxes and specific activities represented by boxes. But what is more important than these symbols is that the sequence of the working process must be clearly described. 

The flow chart can also be used to design and improve the working process, by first drawing out what things should be done, and then comparing them with the actual situation.


You can select process to draw Process model through `icon library`
