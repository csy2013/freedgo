# Export a diagram to various file formats

 You can export your diagrams to various types of images, files of different types, and even encode your diagram into a URL. The type of file that you choose to export to will depend on how you want to use it. 

 - xml save file formats contain your full diagram, and can be opened in freedgo。
 - .png, .svg and .jpeg are image file formats that you can use in documents, presentation slides or on web pages.。
 - .html creates HTML code which embeds your diagram on a web page. 
 - .pdf generates a PDF document. 
 
 
# Export your diagram to an image

You can export the current drawing canvas to an image: PNG, JPEG or SVG. JPEG are most commonly used in web pages. PNG and SVG images are scalable (resizeable) and work well in documents and presentation slides.

Tip: When you export to a PNG or SVG image, you can choose to embed your diagram. When someone imports the image back into freedgo, they will be able to see your full diagram.


##  Select File > Export as then choose the image format you want to generate - PNG, JPEG, or SVG.
