#### Layer

Shows the hierarchy of different icons in the page, which is also provided on the `toolbar`

#### Page View 

By default, the workspace is displayed in `Page View`; Its size depends on the choice of paper size. Unchecking this box will cause the workspace to fill the entire window. This option can also be toggled in the `Format Panel`.

####	ScrollBar

By default, vertical and horizontal scroll bars appear next to the chart workspace. 
Disabling this option will delete the scroll bar. 
You can still move in a large picture without scroll bars by right-clicking and dragging, or by navigating through the Outline Window.

####	Tooltip



Comments attached to a specific chart element can be inserted by selecting `edit`-> `edit tooltip` and typing the required information. Disable this option if you do not want to display tooltips. Please note that this will only disable comments you added yourself. Tooltips for drawings that already exist will still be displayed.

####	Grid：


By default, the work area displays a point `grid` to help align the symbols. Toggle this check box to turn the grid on and off. To the right of the grid scale box is the snap grid size selection. The default is 10 pounds. This determines the shape or spacing at which the connectors are aligned with the grid lines. For example, increasing this number to 100 pounds would mean that the shapes and connectors would only be placed at greater intervals. Reducing this number again will allow you to place shapes more accurately. This option can also be switched in the format panel

####	Guide

By default, guides are automatically displayed whenever the center axis or edge is aligned with another nearby shape when moving symbols around the work area. This is to make it easier for symbols to align with each other. In the following example, the user is dragging a rectangle; Its edge is currently aligned with the center axis of another rectangle.

####	Connection point：
