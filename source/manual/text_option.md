text options card Used to configure text settings. The first part, Font, deals with fonts, text alignment and text size, as well as common options for bold, italic and underline.

 Each option is enabled by checking the relevant box, and a color block button appears. Press this button to display a color chart screen.

 You can select the background color by using the color chart of `Fine Grading` or the coarser color chart below it. 
 If you use a finely graded color chart, please note that once you have made a selection, you can adjust the color very accurately using the slider to the right of the main chart.  
 The text field will display the hexadecimal representation of the three primary color components (red, green, and blue) of the currently selected color, and the field background will also change to the selected color. 
 The default choice is white.  Once you are satisfied with your choice, press `Apply` to set the color. 
 Please note that the color block button changes color to reflect your selection.

 The next options are word wrap and text formatting. Enabling word wrap means that when the text reaches the edge of the text box (as shown by the dashed line below), it drags own onto the next line. Compare this with the above text with word wrap disabled.

 The next text options allows you to change the opacity of the text, which is the opposite of transparency. Text with 100% opacity is completely opaque, while text with 0% opacity is completely transparent. 
 Here, we show the same text as before, the same yellow background, but the opacity is 30%.

 Finally, we have a gap. This allows us to display text at different offsets from the text box.
  Next, we see a 30-point offset above and to the right of the default text box
