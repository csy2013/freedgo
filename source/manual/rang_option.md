The` Arrange` tab handles the position and orientation of objects. We can use the provided functions to` move shape`,` rotate shape`,` resize` or` flip shape`.

At the top are the` forward` and` backward` buttons. By default, recently created shapes overlap with old shapes. Here we have an ellipse overlapping the rectangle, because the ellipse is created after the rectangle.

We can reverse the order by highlighting the ellipse so that we can access the Shape Format panel, select the Adjust Graphics tab, and then press the Move to Last button (or right-click the ellipse and select Move to Last from the menu options).

The same effect can be achieved by highlighting the rectangle, selecting the` Adjust Graphics` tab, and then pressing the `Go to Front` button, or right-clicking the rectangle and selecting `Go to Front`. 
Next is the size option. The height and width fields can be changed to resize the shape vertically or horizontally. If you want to keep the ratio of height to width, you can also check the Constraint Scale check box. 
This can also be done by clicking and dragging one of the corners when the shape is highlighted. 
If this box is checked, you will not be able to change this ratio when clicking and dragging, although changing the values in the`height` and` width` boxes will bypass this option. 
To the left of the `Height` and` Width` boxes are the`Auto Resize` buttons. Pressing this key will resize the shape to be large enough to contain any text labels in it.

Here we entered some 30-point text. It is currently too large for a rectangle, so we click on the rectangle, go to the `resize graphics` menu, and then press the `resize automatically` button.

Next we have `position` and two fields: one is the x coordinate for the left side of the shape and the other is the y coordinate for the shape operation. 
Changing the values in these fields will change the shape's location.  
Next we have an angle. These functions handle the rotation of shapes. 
We can click `Rotate`to rotate the shape 90 degrees at a time, or we can type a value in the `Angle `field, and the shape will rotate clockwise by this amount.  The next step is `flip`. This will flip a shape around the central axis, horizontal or vertical. 
If the shapes are symmetrical about the center of the axis, they will not change significantly when flipping is performed unless the shapes have color fills with gradients or otherwise distinguish different directions. 
A good shape to prove this point is a triangle, which looks the same after turning vertically, but not after turning horizontally.  
Finally, we have the edit link button. This is just like selecting `adjust graphics`-> `insert link` from the menu bar
