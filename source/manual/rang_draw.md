title: Layout

The toolbar is located directly below the menu bar and contains a variety of useful functions. These functions can be accessed in other ways, but they are very useful for some users, so a shortcut is needed:

First, we will look at the insertion drop-down menu marked with a+symbol on the far right of the toolbar.
 You can access the same menu from the menu bar by adjusting the graphic insertion.

The functions provided by this drop-down menu can be divided into two categories. The top half consists of the `insert ...` option, while the bottom half consists of the arrangement options: how to quickly build and arrange a collection of chart elements.

###	Insert function

####	Insert text or shape

These functions duplicate double-click to insert text functions and drag and drop rectangles and ovals into the chart area.

####	Insert Link

You can also insert a URL link from this menu. Inserting a link displays the following screen:

####	Insert Image

Images can also be inserted from this menu. Inserting an image displays the following screen:

There are three main ways to add image web addresses to the above fields:  
1. Type or copy a web address directly in the image field. 
2. Drag the image or the web address associated with the image onto the blank window pane. 
3. Add images by browsing the local file system (device storage). 

In each case, the process is very similar to that used when adding new symbols to a custom library, as described in "Using Libraries." Please refer to this page for details.

### Layout

Let's start by looking at ways to quickly create a collection of chart elements. There are many common Layout；; Think of them as customizable templates.

##### Flow and TreeLayout
Let's choose Layout- > horizontal flow as an example. When we select this arrangement option, we will pop up a Layout screen.

![Online Diagram Drawing](/public/themes/freedgo/rang_draw4.png "Layout") 
 
In this space, we can start to build a chart. We have limited ways to build graphs. Keyboard shortcuts are blocked from accessing menus, panels, and toolbars. 
The only way to add elements is to click the-> symbol to the right of the shape. We will do this for the starting element.

The result is similar to what we did in the normal working area. One difference is that the type of shape is chosen for us. We can start to build a chart in this way.   
The location system of each new element is determined and set according to the adjacent elements. You can move elements by clicking and dragging in the usual way.

Please note that once any additional elements are created, any elements moved by the user in this way will be restored to their predefined positions.

You can also resize and rotate shapes and change how connectors are connected to shapes, because these operations can be accomplished by highlighting elements and then using the mouse without using any menus. 
Unlike moving elements, these operations are not reset when new elements are created.  

In the following example, we have enlarged the starting element and rotated its children by 90 degrees.

Once we are satisfied with the chart, we can press Insert and it will be inserted into the normal workspace in the chart. Once inserted, changes can be made using any function of the system. 
Other processes and trees are arranged in the same way. Here is an example of a vertical tree structure that has been inserted into the diagram.

##### From Text

It is possible to build charts using text statements. 
Select Layout-> display the following screen from text, including text of a simple pie chart

This screen is a simple text editor. ; Symbols represent comments. 
Letters are used to indicate each element, while-> is used to indicate the direction of connectors between each element. 
If we leave the sample text unchanged and press Insert, we will get the following figure.

This screen is a simple text editor that can create more complex charts by adding more rows. Suppose we want to introduce the fourth element connected from a. We add the following highlighted lines:

Then press Insert to move the chart to the main workspace.

###	改变Layout

Once imported or otherwise created, any existing chart can be converted to any type of arrangement.
 However, this feature is not available in the toolbar.
  As mentioned earlier, toolbar functions correspond to the functions available when selecting arrange-> insert in the menu bar. Instead, we can choose layout ->Layout and apply any Layout/ arrangement to existing charts.
   You can apply six Layouts in the toolbar and a new layout, radial tree.
   
![Online Diagram Drawing](/public/themes/freedgo/rang_draw14.png "Layout") 
 
Let's select the entire horizontal tree diagram we created before and then apply `arrange`->`layout`->`radial tree` to it. Elements are automatically rearranged by the system to match the selected Layout. In this case, the results are as follows:
