title: Using external or custom fonts
---

If you don’t want to use the fonts that are available by default in diagrams.net, you can use your own custom fonts or external fonts, such as Google’s fonts or web fonts stored on your own server. This is useful when you need to match the style guide of a publication, your company’s corporate image, or to add interest and emphasis in an infographic.

It’s easy to specify a different system font, use a Google font, or even use your own web font by providing its URL.

# How to use a different system font
System fonts are those which are stored on your computer or system. To use a different system font, you’ll need to know the font’s name.

- In the font selection dialog, type the name of the new font, then click Apply. This example uses the Charter system font.

You’ll see your changes applied to the shape or text.

# How to use a Google font
To use a Google font, all you need to know is Google’s font name. This example uses the Satisfy Google font.

# How to use a web font stored externally
You can also use your own web fonts stored somewhere on the web. You need to link to the font file with the file type extension .woff. The example below uses the italics version of the open source web font called SourceSans Pro.
