# What is Value Stream Mapping?

Value Stream Mapping (VSM) is a fundamental tool to identify waste, reduce process waste. It is an essential lean tool for an organization wanting to plan, implement, and improve while on its lean journey. VSM helps users create a solid implementation plan that will maximize their available resources and help ensure that materials and time are used efficiently. Value Stream Analysis is a powerful planning tool to optimize the result of eliminating waste.

But what is a waste anyway?
Waste can come in the form of time, material, and labor.  But it may also be related to the utilization of skill-sets as well as poor planning. VSM helps to optimize process steps and eliminating waste, the only true value is added at each phase of production.

“The elements of an activity that do not add value from the customer perspective”

Seven forms of originally conceived when the Toyota Production System was first conceived and an eighth added when the lean methodology was adopted within the Western World.  In there, 7 / 8 wastes are production process-oriented, while the eighth waste is directly related to management’s ability to utilize personnel.

A trick to memorize them more easily is the acronym “DOWNTIME”:

# Value Stream Mapping Analysis

VSM is a special type of flow chart that uses symbols known as “the language of Lean” to depict and improve the flow of inventory and related information. It combines two powerful tools into one.

 - The Value Analysis differentiates steps that add value in the eyes of the customer from those that do not
 - Flow Analysis calculates the time spent on each step.

 This makes clear the time and effort being spent on non-value adding activities, the cost of doing business, and sets the stage for reducing waste and streamlining the process. The purpose of value stream mapping is to maximize value and minimize waste in several different ways including:

 - Facilitating Clear Communication And Collaboration
 - Encouraging Continuous Improvement Of A Process
 - Enabling Culture Change Within An Organization
 - Creating Visualizations Of Delays, Excess Inventory And Production Constraints


## Value Added, Non-Value Added, Necessary Nonvalue Added Activities
 
*** Value-added activities ***  are those processes that must be completed to satisfy your customer base. 
For example:

 >>> “There’s no way I’ll buy that unless you include…”

*** Nonvalue-added activities *** are production or service-related activities that simply add cost to, or increase time spent on, a product service without increasing its market value (i.e. 8 classic wastes). For example, the repair of machines, storage of inventory, moving materials, maintenance, and
  inspections

*** Necessary non-value adding activities *** don’t contribute to customer satisfaction that they must be done and they are essential and difficult to remove from the operation or production, i.e. comply with regulations or organizational policies, etc.

Note That:

*** Nonvalue-added activities *** consume resources but create no value for the customer. Even if they stopped and they would be invisible to the end-user or customer.

In conclusion, value-added activities should be further optimized for seeking continuous improvement and growth of an organization, while the non-value added activities should be eliminated, or at least minimized as much as possible.

# Value Stream Map Terminology
1. C/T (Cycle Time): Processor Cycle Time = Time To Complete A Task.
2. P/T Or C/O (Changeover Time): The Non-Value Added Time Required To Convert A Line From One Product To Another Changeover Time Or Setup Time To Begin A New Task.
3. VA (Value Added Task): Value-Added Time Or The Time Needed To Complete A Required Task.
4. NVA (None Value Added Task): Non-Value-Added Time = PT – VAT.
5. L/T (Lead Time): Lead Time, Or The Total Time From When A Task Is Started Within A Work Center Until It Leaves The Work Center.
6. FTT (First Time Through): First Time Quality Or First Time Through Quality Yield.
7. T/T (Takt Time): The Average Unit Production Time Needed To Meet Customer Demand.
8. Capacity: A Metric That Indicates How Many Parts Per Day Your Slowest Process Can Handle.

# Value Stream Mapping Example
Value stream maps can be created with flowchart software by following the steps below:

* The first step in value stream mapping is drawing of the PROCESS BOXES for the different process steps, starting from the supplier side going up to the customer side in the information flows area.
* The Second Step draw the different types of process boxes for different kind of production steps under the information flow section called Material flows.
* The third step in value stream mapping is DATABOXES just under each of the process (or production steps), in which data is captured of each of the process steps drawn in the map. Information that might be interesting for VSM design can be put here.

* The fourth step is to draw the CONNECTION METHODS between the process boxes.
* Step fifth step describes linking CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS to the process.
* Step five is the LEAD TIME LADDER on the bottom of the VSM, which shows different aspects of time in the value stream.
The example below shows what a typical value stream map might look like:
