Before introducing the plan view, let's have a brief understanding of the concept of plan view.

# What is a plan view

The plan, also known as the plan, is an integral part of the building engineering drawing. When the measuring area is not large and the radius is less than 10km (even 25km), the water level can be replaced by the water level. Under this premise, the ground scenery in the survey area can be projected onto the plane along the vertical line direction, and reduced according to the specified symbols and proportions to form a similar figure, which is the plan view. The plan is drawn on a scale to show the distribution of living rooms, rooms, spaces and other hardware in the building, including the location maps of main walls, entrances and windows.

The floor plan facilitates communication among draftsmen, architects, real estate developers, interior designers, site workers, decoration and owners, security guards, fire fighters, visitors, etc.
